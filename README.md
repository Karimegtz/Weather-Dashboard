# Weather Dashboard

## Description

Weather Dashboard is a web application that allows users to search for the current and future weather conditions of multiple cities. The application uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data and dynamically updates the HTML and CSS to display the information. The application also stores search history in `localStorage` so that users can easily view the weather conditions for previously searched cities.
